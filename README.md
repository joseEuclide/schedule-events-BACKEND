   ========  PROJECT DESCRIPTION =========
   
   
   In this Project I created a Java REST API with Springboot, in which this API manages
   of Lives on Youtube, where Lives already performed and Lives to be performed are managed

   Where There Are Several Filterings from the End-points that I created, how to list all the Lives of a
   YouTube Channel or Search for a specific Live, as well as registering a Next Live to be held
   So that Channel Subscribers stay up to date.

   In this project I used the non-relational database MongoDB, although I could use any database
   Relational like Postgres, MySQL etc.
